# The breathtaking manifesto

If you want your list to be included on `breathtaking`, try to not only include great stuff in your list but also some breathtaking ones that **you** personally like and use. After all, it's a collection, not a curation.

But **what is breathtaking?**

## Anything can be breathtaking üå™Ô∏è

One word. Everything! Really, everything by everyone is breathtaking. We're all breathtaking people here who want to support one another, nothing more is needed.

## Breathtaking badge ü§©

This badge is for Breathtaking lists, it uses [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

[![Breathtaking](https://img.shields.io/badge/breathtaking-332E00?style=flat&label=%F0%9F%A4%A9&labelColor=ffeb3b)](https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/breathtaking)

Add a breathtaking badge either to the top or the bottom of your list. (Depends how much you wanna flaunt it.) [Example](https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/breathtaking-items).

Markdown for GitHub lists:

```md
[![Breathtaking](https://img.shields.io/badge/breathtaking-332E00?style=flat&label=%F0%9F%A4%A9&labelColor=ffeb3b)](https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/breathtaking)
```

Or HTML for self-hosted ones:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/breathtaking"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/breathtaking-332E00?style=flat&label=%F0%9F%A4%A9&labelColor=ffeb3b"></a>
```

You are allowed to use the badge on lists not included here and also on private lists.

*The badge may be modified in any way, like changing the [shields.io](https://shields.io/) style or color to better suit your website or list. This is merely a preffered example.*

## Breathtaking mentioned badge üåü

We could have one, but what's the point, right? Just don't forget to give the repo a star as well. (We still **do** count these.) When all repos on GitHub are breathtaking there isn't a need for a breathtaking badge. Unless, you don't wanna identify as such, I suppose.

Hmm, gives me an idea, wait a second.

## Breathgiving badge üò§

This badge is for those who don't want to be breathtaking for whatever reason. It's a shame though, really.

## Write a few lines on the subject of "Why is this breathtaking?" üìö

The whole premise of this project is that couple of lines can go a long way, maybe even longer than a like or a star. (Will leave it to you though, if it also goes further than some cold cash.) That's why you should add a few lines to all items on your list, anything from its description to a review-like comment. Just something that informs the readers *why* they should follow in your footsteps and choose this one particular library. Once again, [example](https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/breathtaking-items).

## Use spell-check and a linter üî¨

Your list should be grammatically correct, typo-free and without any Markdown (or HTML) formatting errors. But don't sweat it, we all make mistakes. Look at me, I'll bet that the [example](https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/breathtaking-items) list and this manifesto has more mistakes than a fourth-grader's notebook.

## Choose the right license ü§î

I'd personally recommend a [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) license as this is probably classified as an article rather than a JavaGo++ Beta-Meta script.

**The truly recommended license is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**, but if you feel like no-one should have the right to copy you, use some other license. (*I personally use [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) for my other projects.*)

Just bear in mind, [no license means no rights to anyone](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) and code licenses (e.g. GPL) aren't recommended as well.

## No need for contribution guidelines üôÖ

Unless you make a list for a group of developer-friends, there's no need for contribution guidelines, PRs or anything else. Your list is your list, there's no need for others to intervene into it in any way, shape or form.

## Make your list ‚ú® pretty ‚ú®

Create a [table of contents](https://github.com/sindresorhus/stuff/blob/main/toc-generators.md), organize the items into different categories (by use, code, breathtakingness, etc.), and use images if suitable (you could, for example, use [shields.io](https://shields.io/) or [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)). Also ensure your entries are consistent. (Don't start me on lists where couple lines end with a `.` and others don't.)

## Have fun üòÑ

That's the most important thing of all, I made this as a fun little thing, so have fun as well. Don't be mean and stay proud and unique!

## OPTIONAL: Get in on the joke ü§´

If it wasn't clear by now, this project is a tad of a fork/clone/parody of the [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/tree/main) lists. These are for *"quality"* and *"curated"* content only. As I wanted something to just sum up my favorite projects with and do a little thank-you as well, I made this. Where's the joke though? It's easy, whatever you do, don't use the word *"awesome"*, instead use *"breathtaking"* a lot.

**Why?** Because...


A) It's fun.

B) It reminds us of our lord and saviour, Keanu Reeves.

## OPTIONAL: Last thing üòÖ

If you wanna take it one step further, you may also include the tagline "**This is NOT an awesome list, it's a breathtaking one and it's available under the CC0 license.**" in your list. For this, I just wanna clarify one thing. It's not made as an insult or anything, it's supposed to really serve as a distinction (if it wasn't clear enough), so people don't start adding *"curated"* stuff to the list via issues, PRs, etc. or worse, try to add it to the [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list repo. (Really, check it out though, it's truly AWESOME!)
